## No measurement errors ## 

This folder contains the parameter estimates and the corresponding gradients predicted by GAM without measurement errors, which were generated by the .R files **PDE_GradientMatching_Functions.R** and **PDE_GradientMatching_NoMeasurementError.R** and 
stored in **Reference gradients GAM.txt** and **Reference gradients GAM.rds**.
